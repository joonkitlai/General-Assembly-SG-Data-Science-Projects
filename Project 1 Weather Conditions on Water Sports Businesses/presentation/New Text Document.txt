Perform any additional cleaning that you feel is necessary.

Using sorting and/or masking (along with the .head() method to avoid printing our entire dataframe), consider questions relevant to your problem statement. Feel free to explore other trends based on the datasets that you have choosen for analysis. 

Make sure you include at least one example of sorting your dataframe by a column, and one example of using boolean filtering (i.e., masking) to select a subset of the dataframe.

#Include all month labels. 
#Consider including KDE 
OPTIONAL: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)

Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.
